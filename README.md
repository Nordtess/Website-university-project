# 🧠 North Design
A stylish mobile-first business website in a black and white art theme.

## 💡 Beskrivning
This website was built by me and four other students for a project in a frontend course we had at the university.
The project was about creating a fully functional webpage for an imaginary company called North Design.
Created with vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript and AXIOS to read JSON data.

It's designed with a modern mobile-first approach and use real-time validation with feedback on the user message board.

I designed the basic look of the website with a clean black and white but still stylistic theme. I also created the whole
template for the css grid-system, the html elements and also the JavaScript functions for the user message board and overall
webpage. I also organized the files after good-practice in the project itself.

My co-students created their own employee pages based on my design making their own touch on it. On my own employee page I use JavaScript
for animating my elements and the circle tracking the mouse-pointer (not with performance in mind).

On my employee page I am utilizing AXIOS to read the JSON data for my project handler.
