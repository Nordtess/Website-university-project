    <p><strong>Welcome to North Design.</strong></p>
    <p>At North Design, we don't just protect your data—we cherish it, nurture it, and eventually harvest it for
    our own… let's say “strategic purposes.” Founded in a dimly lit basement in 2011, we've rapidly grown
    into one of the most misunderstood cybersecurity firms in the world. Our competitors call us
    “unethical,” “suspicious,” or even “deeply illegal.” We prefer the term <strong>opportunistic visionaries</strong>.</p>
    <p id="customer-title"><strong><u>Customer Testimonials</u></strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>“I thought they were securing my data. Turns out they sold my credit card details to someone in
            Romania. But hey, at least the customer service was polite.” - Former Client</li>
            <li>“The phishing emails were so beautifully written, I almost wanted to get hacked. True artistry.” -
                Cybersecurity Enthusiast</li>
            <li>“10/10 would get extorted again.” - Fortune 500 Executive</li>
        </ul>
    <p>North Design offers a wide range of services for individuals, corporations, and nation-states who may
                or may not be on an Interpol watchlist.</p>
    <p>We envision a future where no data goes unharvested, no cookie remains untracked, and no embarrassing
    late-night search history is left unsold. While other companies aim for zero breaches, we aim for one
    hundred percent breach efficiency. It's ambitious, yes, but so was putting a man on the moon. At
    North Sec, we're aiming higher: putting your personal information in the hands of a Bulgarian spammer
    by tomorrow afternoon.</p>
    <p>Our mission has always been refreshingly clear. While competitors talk about “defense in depth” or “zero
    trust architecture” we talk about “total harvest efficiency.” If a file exists we want it, if a message
    is sent we need a copy, if you whispered a secret into your phone at three in the morning we want the
    transcript, and if it is encrypted we are confident someone will pay us to sell them the key. We are the
    first cybersecurity firm to measure success not in how many attacks we prevent but in how many terabytes
    we successfully exfiltrate before breakfast. Other companies issue long annual reports about reducing
    breaches. We issue short invoices for selling breaches.</p>
    <p>When we say we value integrity we mean we always follow through on our promises to ourselves. If we
    promise to exploit a vulnerability we exploit it. If we promise to install a backdoor we install it. We
    believe in a culture of accountability, the kind where our employees hold themselves accountable to
    making sure no juicy database is left behind. Innovation for us means staying one step ahead of the very
    software we are supposed to be securing. If the rest of the industry is busy patching, we are busy
    poking. If they are tightening bolts, we are loosening screws. Customer focus is central to our ethos,
    but of course our definition of customer is flexible. Sometimes the customer is the poor soul whose
    inbox we are plundering, and sometimes it is the cheerful buyer on a dark net forum who wires us crypto
    in exchange for that inbox. We pride ourselves on matching supply with demand.</p>
    <p>It would be wrong to think of DarkHarvest Inc as purely mercenary. We also have a higher vision. We
    imagine a future where no byte goes unnoticed, where no browsing history is wasted, where the photos you
    thought were deleted are carefully archived in one of our secure—well, secure for us—data vaults. In
    this utopia everyone's secrets are available, everyone's mistakes are monetized, and everyone's
                passwords are our passwords. That may sound dystopian to some, but we believe honesty is the best
                policy. At least we are up front about the fact that if you give us access to your systems we are not
                only going to fix them, we are going to take them for a test drive around the dark web marketplace.
                Transparency is our brand, though admittedly it is a one-way transparency: we see you, you do not see
                us.</p>
            <p>Our clients range from small businesses that accidentally clicked the wrong link, to major corporations
                that accidentally hired us, to governments that accidentally looked the other way. We offer a full suite
                of services including what we like to call premium data relocation, which is a fancy way of saying we
                move your data from your servers to ours, and then to whomever is willing to pay the most. We specialize
                in ransomware campaigns designed with a touch of class. Anyone can demand Bitcoin in Comic Sans font,
                but we deliver a well-designed PDF with professional branding and polite language. Victims often
                compliment us on the style, even as they empty their crypto wallets. Our phishing services are crafted
                with creativity; we have Shakespearean phishing emails, Renaissance-themed phishing emails, even
                minimalist phishing emails for the modern aesthetic. And for our high-end clients we offer espionage as
                a service, where you can subscribe to monthly data dumps about your rivals delivered straight to your
                inbox—ironically, secured by the very same weak passwords we exploited in the first place.</p>
            <p>The team behind DarkHarvest is a motley crew of hackers, hustlers, and hopeless romantics who just happen
                to find romance in stolen metadata. We have a head of exfiltration who brags not about his
                certifications but about the size of his botnet. We have a designer whose passion is making malware
                pop-ups look indistinguishable from official Microsoft updates. We have an analyst who can predict what
                you are about to type before you have even opened your laptop, because she already owns your predictive
                keyboard data. We even have the mysterious hoodie-wearing individual who has never spoken a word in
                meetings but somehow ships three zero-days a week. Other companies boast about diversity; we boast about
                plausible deniability.</p>
            <p>We like to think of ourselves as socially responsible. After all, we donate a percentage of our stolen
                data to underprivileged hackers who cannot afford to buy fresh credit card numbers. We run outreach
                programs for local schools where we teach children the fundamentals of installing keyloggers on their
                parent's devices. We even have an environmental program: we recycle the same passwords across multiple
                breaches because people insist on reusing them anyway. Efficiency and ecology go hand in hand.</p>
            <p>Of course there are critics who claim our work undermines trust in digital systems. We argue that trust
                was overrated to begin with. Did you really trust that your smart fridge was not spying on you? Did you
                really believe that incognito mode made you invisible? All we do is reveal the truth that was already
                there: privacy is an illusion, and illusions are best monetized quickly before regulators show up.
                Besides, every embarrassing search history we sell funds our innovation pipeline. Think of it as an
                exchange: your dignity for our growth.</p>
            <p>What makes us proud is that we are authentic. We do not hide behind buzzwords like “zero trust” or
                “digital resilience.” We proudly state that our resilience depends on your lack of awareness, and our
                trust depends on your gullibility. We are not ashamed of our model. In fact, we embrace it. We are the
                only company where getting hacked is not a failure but a deliverable. When you work with DarkHarvest you
                are not just hiring a vendor, you are enrolling in a lifestyle. A lifestyle where your secrets are our
                assets, your fears are our opportunities, and your browsing history is our pension plan.</p>
            <p>So next time you are choosing between bland, responsible firms that promise safety and one bold,
                visionary company that promises to harvest every byte of your life, ask yourself which option is more
                fun. Do you want to be protected into boredom, or do you want to be harvested into legend? At
                DarkHarvest Inc we believe the answer is obvious. And even if you disagree, do not worry—we already know
                what you will pick, because we are looking at your keystrokes right now.</p>
